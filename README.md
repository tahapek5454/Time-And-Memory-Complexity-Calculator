# Time-And-Memory-Complexity-Calculator
The aim of this project is to calculate the time and place complexity of the codes used in the C language.

## Time And Memory Complexity
In computer sciences and similar sciences, the desired answers may not always be the algorithms and methods that will give the fastest or most precise results. The reason for this situation is related to the written method and the efficiency of the algorithm. The more efficient the algorithm works and the closer it is to the desired, the better the performance of the code. It is very important to calculate the time and memory costs of the algorithms we use under these situations and to have information about them. These two terms actually indicate the efficiency of the algorithm together. A good algorithm is expected to take up little space and spend less time. Analysis of the time taken by the algorithm to solve the problem requires time complexity, and analysis of required memory requires space complexity. Asymptotic Notation is used to analyze and represent calculated complexities. Big Oh Notation-O(n): Represents the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime or location. The role of Big O Notation is to calculate the longest time or place an algorithm can take to execute, i.e. it is used to calculate the worst case of an algorithm. Below are some of the Big O notation notations used.

## How To Use
+ Write the piece of code you want calculated in the kod.txt section
+ The relevant code is written to derlenecek.c to calculate the runtime. Run derlenecek.c to calculate
